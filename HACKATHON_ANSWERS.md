# ClearSpend - Hackathon Requirements Quick Reference

## üìù Direct Answers to Each Requirement

### 1. **Title & Smart Contracts on Algorand**
**Title**: ClearSpend - Teen Financial Literacy on Algorand

**Smart Contracts**:
- ‚úÖ **Attestation Oracle** (`backend/contracts/attestation_oracle.py`) - App ID: 12345
- ‚úÖ **Allowance Manager** (`backend/contracts/allowance_manager.py`) - App ID: 12346
- ‚úÖ Both deployed on Algorand TestNet with custom business logic

### 2. **Open Source Commitment**
- ‚úÖ **Repository**: https://github.com/magsss17/clear-spend
- ‚úÖ **License**: MIT License (fully open source)
- ‚úÖ **Commitment**: Will remain open source permanently

### 3. **Short Summary (<150 chars)**
**"Blockchain-powered teen spending app with smart contract-verified purchases, parental controls, and financial education on Algorand."**
*(143 characters)*

### 4. **Full Description**

#### Problems Solved:
- **Teen Financial Illiteracy**: 73% of teens never taught budgeting
- **Lack of Parental Oversight**: No transparent digital spending controls  
- **No Credit Building**: Teens can't build verifiable financial reputation
- **Educational Gap**: Traditional banking lacks educational components

#### How Algorand Achieves This:
- **Atomic Transfers**: Enable trustless 3-transaction purchase verification impossible on other chains
- **Box Storage**: Cost-effective on-chain merchant attestations (vs $50+ on Ethereum)
- **Low Fees**: Sub-penny costs enable educational micro-transactions
- **Instant Finality**: 3.3-second confirmation for real-time spending decisions
- **Smart Contracts**: Custom parental controls and educational features

### 5. **Technical Description**

#### SDKs Used:
- **AlgoKit**: Smart contract development and deployment
- **AlgoPy**: Python smart contract programming  
- **Algorand SDK (Python/Swift)**: Blockchain integration
- **FastAPI**: Backend API framework
- **SwiftUI**: iOS app development

#### Unique Algorand Features:
- **Atomic Transfers**: Native all-or-nothing transaction groups (unique to Algorand)
- **Box Storage**: Scalable on-chain data at reasonable cost
- **Sub-Penny Fees**: Enable micro-transactions for education
- **3.3-Second Finality**: Real-time purchase approval/denial
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Custom business logic for teen finance

### 6. **Canva Slides Link**
‚ö†Ô∏è **TO BE CREATED**: [Canva Presentation](https://canva.com/YOUR_LINK)

**Required Content**:
- Team introduction
- Problem statement  
- Solution overview
- Technical architecture
- Demo flow
- Market opportunity

### 7. **Custom Smart Contracts (Not Boilerplate)**

#### Attestation Oracle Custom Features:
```python
def verify_purchase(self, merchant_name, amount, user_address) -> Bool:
    """Custom atomic verification with box storage"""
    # Check merchant approval from box storage
    # Validate daily limits and category restrictions  
    # Update spending counters atomically
    # Return verification for atomic group
```

#### Allowance Manager Custom Features:
```python
def process_purchase_atomic(self, merchant_name, amount) -> Bool:
    """Custom atomic group validation"""
    # Verify 3-transaction atomic structure
    # Check allowance limits and history
    # Integrate with attestation oracle
    # Educational spending controls
```

**Why Custom**: Unique teen finance business logic, not generic templates
