‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Resources/          # Assets and resources
```

### Key Components

#### Views
- **HomeView**: Dashboard with balance and recent transactions
- **SpendView**: Purchase interface with merchant selection
- **InvestView**: Savings and investment education
- **LearnView**: Financial literacy modules
- **SettingsView**: App configuration and parental controls

#### Services
- **AlgorandService**: Blockchain interaction and transaction management

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Purchase Flow
1. **Teen initiates purchase** in iOS app
2. **App calls backend API** with purchase details
3. **Backend verifies purchase** through oracle service
4. **Atomic transaction group created**:
   - Attestation Oracle verification
   - Allowance Manager check
   - Payment execution
5. **Transaction confirmed** and result returned to app
6. **UI updated** with transaction status

### Allowance Flow
1. **Parent issues allowance** via backend API
2. **Smart contract validates** timing and permissions
3. **ASA transfer executed** to teen's wallet
4. **Transaction logged** for history tracking
5. **Teen receives notification** of new allowance

## üîí Security Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin access

### Parental Controls
- **Merchant Approval**: Parent control over merchant access
- **Spending Limits**: Daily and category-based restrictions
- **Allowance Management**: Pause/resume and emergency controls
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Real-time spending visibility

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### System Monitoring
