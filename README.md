## Problem Statement

**The Challenge:** Teens lack transparent, educational tools for managing money digitally while parents struggle to monitor and guide spending habits effectively. Traditional teen debit cards offer limited controls and no verifiable spending history for building credit reputation.

**The Impact:** 
- 73% of teens have never been taught how to budget
- Parents can't verify where teen spending actually occurs
- No transparent system for building financial reputation from a young age
- Traditional banking tools lack educational components and real-time controls

## Our Solution

ClearSpend leverages **Algorand's unique blockchain features** to create a trustless system where:

- **Every purchase is pre-verified** before money moves using atomic transfers  
- **Parents set smart controls** via on-chain attestations and box storage  
- **Teens build verifiable spending history** for future credit through blockchain records  
- **Educational gamification** teaches financial literacy with real-world consequences  

### Why Algorand?
- **Atomic Transfers**: Enables trustless purchase verification in single transaction groups
- **Box Storage**: Efficient on-chain storage for merchant attestations and spending limits
- **Low Fees**: Enables micro-transactions for educational purposes
- **Speed**: Instant transaction confirmation for real-time purchase approval
- **Smart Contracts**: Custom logic for complex parental controls and educational features

## Custom Smart Contracts

### 1. Attestation Oracle Contract (`backend/contracts/attestation_oracle.py`)

**Custom Features:**
- **Box Storage Implementation**: Efficient on-chain merchant attestation storage
- **Atomic Purchase Verification**: Verifies purchases as part of atomic transaction groups
- **Dynamic Daily Limits**: Per-merchant spending limits that reset automatically
- **Category Restrictions**: Blocks purchases from restricted categories (gambling, adult content)
- **Parent Approval System**: On-chain parent approval for specific merchants

```python
@arc4.abimethod
def verify_purchase(
    self,
    merchant_name: String,
    amount: UInt64,
    user_address: arc4.Address
) -> Bool:
    """
    Custom verification logic that:
    1. Checks merchant attestation from box storage
    2. Validates daily spending limits
    3. Enforces category restrictions
    4. Updates spending counters atomically
    """
```

### 2. Allowance Manager Contract (`backend/contracts/allowance_manager.py`)

**Custom Features:**
- **Timelock Savings**: Teens can lock funds until specific future dates
- **Emergency Allowance**: Parents can issue immediate funds bypassing weekly limits
- **Atomic Purchase Processing**: Validates purchases as part of 3-transaction atomic groups
- **Allowance Control Transfer**: Parents can transfer control to other guardians
- **Pause/Resume System**: Instant allowance suspension for discipline

```python
@arc4.abimethod
def process_purchase_atomic(
    self,
    merchant_name: String,
    amount: UInt64
) -> Bool:
    """
    Custom atomic transaction processing:
    - Validates atomic group structure (3 transactions)
    - Checks allowance limits
    - Logs purchase for transparency
    - Integrates with attestation oracle
    """
```

### Atomic Transaction Flow
```
Group Transaction 1: Attestation Oracle Verification
Group Transaction 2: Allowance Manager Validation  
Group Transaction 3: Payment Execution
→ ALL succeed or ALL fail (atomic guarantee)
```

## Technical Implementation

### SDKs and Technologies Used

#### Blockchain & Smart Contracts
- **AlgoKit**: Smart contract development and deployment framework
- **AlgoPy**: Python-based smart contract programming
- **Algorand SDK (Python)**: Blockchain interaction and transaction management
- **Algorand SDK (Swift)**: iOS app blockchain integration

#### Backend Architecture
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async API framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **AsyncPG**: Asynchronous PostgreSQL database driver
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment

#### iOS Development
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Combine**: Reactive programming for data flow
- **Foundation**: Core iOS functionality
- **CryptoKit**: Cryptographic operations

### Unique Algorand Features Utilized

#### 1. Atomic Transfers
**Why Unique to Algorand:** Other blockchains require complex multi-signature setups or separate smart contracts for atomic operations. Algorand's native atomic transfers enable trustless purchase verification in a single transaction group.

**Our Implementation:**
```swift
// iOS App creates atomic group
let attestationTxn = ApplicationCallTxn(/* verify purchase */)
let allowanceTxn = ApplicationCallTxn(/* check limits */)
let paymentTxn = PaymentTxn(/* execute payment */)
let groupId = assign_group_id([attestationTxn, allowanceTxn, paymentTxn])
```

#### 2. Box Storage
**Why Unique to Algorand:** Ethereum's storage is expensive and limited. Algorand's box storage provides efficient, scalable on-chain data storage perfect for merchant attestations.

**Our Implementation:**
```python
# Efficient merchant attestation storage
merchant_key = self._create_merchant_key(merchant_name)
merchant_box = BoxRef(key=merchant_key)
merchant_box.put(attestation.bytes)
```

#### 3. Low Transaction Costs
**Why Critical for Our Use Case:** Teen spending involves frequent small transactions. Ethereum gas fees would make micro-transactions impossible. Algorand's low fees enable real educational spending.

#### 4. Instant Finality
**Why Essential:** Teens expect instant purchase approval/denial. Algorand's 3.3-second finality enables real-time spending decisions.
